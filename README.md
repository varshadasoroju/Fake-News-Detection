Count Vectorizer was used as a vectorization method in order to pre-process the words. 3 algorithms were used in order to train the dataset and evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning model.
1)Passive agressive classifier
2)MultinomailNB classifier
3)Multinomial using Hyperparameter classifier. 
As the dataset used to test and train the model is very large, this is the link to the dataset acquired from the Kaggle website:
